# SWOT Analysis:Google Cloud

## Strengths
* Data Center investments is their asset and the fact that their regions are connected by a private network gives them an edge and enterprise credentials
* Machine Learning and AI are their strengths and gives them an edge over both AWS and Azure
* Google is well positioned to offer the best in class security with their assets and expertise. But jury is out on whether it is enough to convince enterprise customers

## Weakness
* They are yet to gain widespread enterprise traction. We would love to see customers moving “all in” with Google cloud
* Even though they have beefed up Google App Engine, it is yet to attract significant attention
* Their multi cloud pitch shows their weakness in the cloud market. Even though multi cloud is fast becoming a reality, a public cloud provider using the pitch in high decibels is more indicative of their challenges in the market
* They are still in a weak spot compared to AWS when it comes to Functions as a Service. After seeing the success of all the AWS Lambda sessions in the last re:invent, I expected Google to come out swinging. Even though their announcement regarding Firebase integration with Google Cloud Functions offers promise, they have a long way to go before they can catch up with AWS Lambda

## Opportunities
* Even though AWS has the runaway lead, the infrastructure market is huge and tons of legacy targets available for both Microsoft and Google. Google is positioning themselves to gain significant portion of the remaining cloud market
* With the success of Tensorflow in the community, Google has the potential to attract a significant share of Machine Learning workloads. With their advantages in AI, they have an opportunity to become the cloud of choice for not just ML and AI focussed startups but also the enterprise customers
* Their inter region network and security focus will help them gain credibility with the enterprises

## Threats
* Google’s go to market strategy to attract enterprise customers is still not very convincing. Yes, Google cloud’s top leadership is packed with proven enterprise leaders from VMware, Red Hat, etc. but there is lack of clarity on their approach. They are neither taking the AWS approach to enterprise customers nor taking a traditional enterprise path. They seem to be playing a middle ground and it runs the risk of not being attractive enough for enterprises
* I love their Engineering Support announcement and how they are trying to incorporate AI into customer success. But some of the requirements for their support model could be upsetting the enterprise customers and may come back to bite them. I fully understand why these requirements are needed from a support logistics point of view but we will have to wait and see if it works
