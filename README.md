# SWOT

Rishidot Research publishes our [strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) (SWOT) analysis in Markdown format in a Git repository. The reasons for publishing it here are
* Easy accessibility and easy embed into any document
* Version control ensures context as the SWOT analysis is updated in the future
* Vendors and community can use the pull request as a way to dispute analysis, add suggestions, etc.. This ensures that our analysis remains objective and openly peer reviewed instead of doing it within the confines of a secretive research organizations like other analyst firms in the market
