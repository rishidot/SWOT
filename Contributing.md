#SWOT Contributor Guidelines

The main contribution to this repo comes from research analysts at Rishidot Research. However, we strongly encourage practitioners to contribute to SWOT analysis. We feel that incorporating practitionerâ€™s voice into our analysis gives more credence to our analysis and will be more useful to other practitioners. 

Any vendor whose company/platform/product is published here can do a pull request to point out any factual inaccuracies in our analysis. 

The following are the guidelines for contributing to SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threat) repository:

* Before opening a new request, create an issue and use the commenting to disable the merits. Once a consensus is reached, you can attach a pull request. Feel free to use [https://github.com/github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub) or [http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)
* If you are a practitioner and doing a PR for the first time, we would require some evidence for your experience. A LinkedIn profile or a blog where you showcase your experience will speed up merge. We have this requirement for quality control
* If you are a vendor, you can only do a PR on a SWOT analysis related to your product/platform
* A PR to fix a factual error with evidence will get accepted and one without any evidence will not get accepted. Everything in between goes through issues and the final decision will be taken based by Rishidot Research analysts who will verify it or use their knowledge to decide
* We recommend industry best practices like i) making pull requests smaller ii) write useful title and description, make on point commit messages, provide hard evidence including any authoritative links in public domain (we do not accept content inside paywall or a form)

If you are a vendor doing a pull request and cannot provide any evidence in public due to proprietary nature of the evidence, please [contact us](http://rishidot.com/contact-us/)
