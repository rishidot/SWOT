#SWOT Contributor Guidelines

The main contributions to this repo comes from research analysts at Rishidot Research. 
However, we strongly encourage practitioners to contribute to this SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threat) analysis. 
We feel that incorporating practitionerâ€™s voice into our analysis gives more credence to our analysis and will be more useful to other practitioners. 

Any vendor whose company/platform/product is published here can do a pull request to point out any factual inaccuracies in our analysis. 

The following are the guidelines for contributing to the SWOT repository:

* Before opening a new request, create an issue and use the commenting to discuss the merits. 
Once a consensus is reached, you can submit a pull request. 
Feel free to use [https://github.com/github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub) or [http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)
* If you are a practitioner and doing a PR for the first time, we would require some evidence for your experience. 
A LinkedIn profile or a blog where you showcase your experience will speed up merge. We have this requirement for quality control.
* If you are a vendor, you can only do a PR on a SWOT analysis related to your product/platform.
* A PR to fix a factual error with acceptable evidence will generally get accepted, while one without appropriate evidence will not get accepted. 
Everything in between goes through the issues discussion workflow and the final decision will be taken by Rishidot Research analysts who will verify it or use their knowledge to decide.
* We recommend industry best practices like: 
  1. making small, focused pull requests as opposed to a PR addressing more than one point
  1. write a useful title and description, make an on point commit messages, 
  and provide hard evidence, including any authoritative links that are in the public domain.
  We do not accept content inside a paywall of any form.

If you are a vendor doing a pull request and cannot provide any evidence in public due to the proprietary nature of the evidence, 
please [contact us](http://rishidot.com/contact-us/)
